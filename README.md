A portfolio project on "Spam Classification".

Author: Muhammad Zeeshan.

Hello Reader,
I am Muhammad Zeeshan, a budding Data Scientist, with passion for machine learning.
This Project is one of my many Portfolio Projects that I have so far created to practice my data skills. 

In this Project, I have worked with an SMS dataset available on kaggle. I first cleaned it, pre-processed it, manipulated it and then trained my model on it.
As part of my exploration, i initially trained multiple models like Guassian Naive Bayes, Multinomial Naive Bayes, Clustering algorithm, decision trees and 5 others.
I then calculated their metrics which narrowed down my selection to three models only. I then attempted to fine-tune my vectorizer, applied different encoders and calculated the metrics again.

This time, however, MultiNomial Naive Bayes came out to be the best model with an accuracy score of 0.97 and precision score of 1. Therefore, I decided to train this particular model.

Lastly, as its name suggest, this is a classification project that classify text data based on the pattern between spam or not spam.

Thank You.
